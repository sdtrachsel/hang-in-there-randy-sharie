# Hang in There  

### Abstract:
* We implemented functionality that allows a user to generate random motivational posters, create their own poster and save posters of their liking. We also created functionality for the user to delete any saved posters.  

### Installation Instructions:
* The person first has to find the repo sdtrachsel/hang-in-there-randy-sharie on github.
* Above the list of files will be a green button called code with a dropdown menu.
* Copy down the repo of the URL using the SSH key and click the two little squares to the right of the URL.
* Open your terminal and find the directory where you would like to clone down the repo.
* After the desired directory is found you want to type git clone and paste the URL you copied from github.
* Press enter to make a local copy clone and then you're done.

### Context:
* This project took approximately 15 hours to complete. This includes time spent researching, coding individually and pairing, as well as documentation. We're currently in week 2 of a 6 month intensive program through Turing School Software and Design. 

### Contributors:
* The two contributors to this appplication are:
* Sharie Trachsel https://github.com/sdtrachsel
* Randy Cisneros https://github.com/RandyGitProjects

### Learning Goals:
* Our goals were to write dry javascript utilizing a provided class and manipulating the page by updating the dom. We also focused on demonstrating and understanding our connection between HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Through the process we strengthened our skills in working collaboratively.
* We utilized git workflow and github to enhance collaboration and code integrity. 

### Wins + Challenges:
* A general win was our use of pseudo coding and planning to prevent extensive code rewrites as features were implemented. 

* Our biggest win and challenge was implementing the ability to view saved posters in a grid and to allow the user to delete a selected poster with a double click. This implementation required us to obtain the knowledge of how css and html were handling the display grid and how we could manipulate and allow a user to interact with the grid. We utilized the element ID and even.target to allow for seamless deletion.
